# Advanced Named Entity Recognition (NER)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building an advanced **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** system capable of processing **multilingual text data**. It integrates **Vector Space Models (VSMs)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks to identify entities such as people, locations, organizations, and more with high accuracy.

The goal is to improve entity extraction performance, especially for large language models (LLMs) working in diverse linguistic environments.
